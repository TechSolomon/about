# Alaska Developers Alliance Operating Manual

This document serves as a repository for running the Alaska Developers Alliance. It describes the organizational structure, functional requirements for the board, budget, group promotion, running and hosting events and the necessary institutional knowledge that the group acquires.

## Dev Alliance Yearly Calendar

August through November is the “startup ecosystem” time. To get the best results and create the most opportunities for programmers, we should orchestrate our events in line with the startup ecosystem to inject practitioners into the talent pool.This schedule would create a pipeline where yearly events build up regular attendance, foster community, and gravity to bring in new professionals.

1. July begin planning the following year
2. August starts outreach and engagement with students attracts new members as soon as they start classes.
3. September provide a bootcamp on specific technology that is 100% free to students and mixes students with existing talent. Also incorporate a meetup so students can be in relaxed environment and socialize.
4. October provides events for programmers to be involved with industry(aka find internships and jobs) and build fun stuff in order to bond and create relationships. We inform students and teams that projects can win entry into startup weekend in November where resources are given for teams to vet turning their project into a business. Developer Survey
5. November programmers specifically invited into startup weekend. Need to find good incentives for them to participate. Board Retreat to incorporate what has been learned into next year.
6. December we relax with a casual social event to help students find jobs, work on resume, and have a social time to hang out
7. January we begin UA recruitment cycle. Include social and meetup
8. February we have a meetup
9. March includes a workshop for engagement and a meetup
10. April includes second casual event for students to focus on career at the end of the semester
One last meetup to set us up for the summer break
