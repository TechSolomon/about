## Streaming

Decide on one person who is responsible for the stream
Create FB Live and YouTube live events
Doing this in advance helps advertising
Verify the FB stream at least 20 minutes before the scheduled time
https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/2087325741287572
Start the broadcast 15 minutes before the meeting so you have time to diagnose issues
Do not go live until the meeting starts
Start the broadcast when the speaker is ready and verify broadcast is running
Do not stop your broadcast software after it has started.
Facebook will not let you reuse the old stream if this happens
Monitor the stream for issues and questions throughout the meeting
