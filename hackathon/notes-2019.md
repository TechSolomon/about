# Hackathon 2019 notes. Arsh, Conroy, Vince, Jeff

General sentiment. Lots of stress and planning. Day of, just winged it anyway. Expectation and reality way different, so stress way less.

Could get more project sponsors involved in Juneau and Fairbanks.

Wasn't what people expected but event turned out great.

TODO

* [ ] Reconcile total budget
  * [ ] Food
  * [ ] Slush fund
  * [ ] Parts
  * [ ] Prizes
  * [ ] Shirts
  * [ ] Stickers
  * [ ] How much did sponsors spend?
  * [ ] What was our total price per person?
  * [ ] reconcile and send out prizes
* [ ] put together detailed timeline for what need to happen next
* [ ] Get printer of shirts from Erik
* [ ] Look at startup weekend docs

## Promotion
create location specific event and blast it out 2 weeks ahead of time.
Link up with makerspaces.
Talk to news 2-3 weeks out
Work with project sponsors to get press and PR
Promote the Reception in the community

## Shirts 
Order from Fairbanks - Get 3 weeks out

## Participation
Lots of people showed up first day or for a few hours at a time.
Lots of attrition by Sunday
Could use to our advantage. Collect small projects for people to jump in and work on for a few hours.
People didn't understand what the event was until they showed up. Could do a better job telling people what the event was going to be.
- people maybe bailed because it wasn't competitive.
- people who couldn't give the whole weekend just didn't show up.
- 
Going to UAF Pub was great for morale - 8 people went

Jeff Like that it wasn't kill yourself and don't sleep for the weekend. Could participate and get sleep and build stuff.

## Budgeting
Fairbanks - slush fund was great for buying parts

## Lots of duplicated effort because we didn't sync of far enough before the event. Made it hard to make the event feel like one big event.

Main Jobs need to be defined ahead of time and then set up pairs to tag-team the task for each location:
UAF had a lot more tasks that could have been split.
  Food
  Programming
  Prizes
  Sponsorship
  Project Sponsors
  Streaming
  
## Comments from ATLA / Industry
Anchorage seemed to build things, whereas Fairbanks was more theoretical. Directly correlated with demographics
Anchorage - mostly professionals. few students
Fairbanks - 1 professional, all students
 
 ## Judging and prizes and presentations made event feel cohesive at the end. 
 ### like doing remote judging via zoom
 ### like table where people can come up and get stuff
 ### different tiers of prizes? some way to make it more fair without 1st, 2nd, 3rd. E.G. single team can't get 2 3d printers or something...
 Need to think more about this.
 ### judges
 Mystie
 Dr. Lawlor
 Melanie Bladow
 Erik Talvi
 Tristan
 Bucky
 Ryan
 
## remote Chapter - spawn from Juneau experience. No need for people to be there
tools worked really well
slack, github, zoom could be used to incorporate Ketchikan, valdez, kotzebue, homer, etc

## Anchorage - participants - 28
  UAA ECB room 203 was great. good AV. Good size room
  WAY over-ordered food
  too many snacks
  really easy to businesses to buy snacks from instacart
    - chips, popcorn, pretzels, drinks, etc
    - way too much coffee. only small carafe from kaladi per day.
  didn't coordinate job duties well. Wasn't sure who was doing what

## Fairbanks - participants - 35-40
Too many jobs for Erik, Arsh, Vince

vince: "Too focused on UAF."
Ryan and Tristan formed Hackathon Club. Earlier conversation to make event more cohesive. 
Students and participants knew event was for Dev Alliance, but news and media did not.


Ended up without coffee
Friday - not enough pizza. Had to order more
Saturday - If you have "hot food" make sure it's fresh. DO NOT REHEAT
UAF had a lot of great available equipment.
  raspi
  3d printers
  electronic motor controls
  resistors
  leds
  access to machine shop
  sodering iron
Realy diverse groups - mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, marketing, artist  + computer science
Dev Alliance Slush fund helped - $500

## Juneau - participants - 3 in person. 2 remote
Ended up being very remote. Lots worked from home.
Worked well for Juneau to just go out instead of ordering food.
Friday - pizzas
Saturday - got donuts, nobody showed up that early
  night: went out with someone
