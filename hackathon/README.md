# Hackathon Playbook

The Alaska Developer’s Alliance, in tandem with UAA and UAF, presents our first ever hackathon. This hackathon is a blend of ideas from members in the community that we believe will lead to a great weekend of learning, cultivating relationships, and building a stronger developer community. The hackathon will span Fairbanks to Anchorage to Junuea and will be accessible statewide for teams willing to work and communicate remotely. If your team is based in another city we encourage you to talk to your teams about traveling to the location where your team is based.
