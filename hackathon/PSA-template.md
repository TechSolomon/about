The Alaska Developers Alliance with the UAF Hackathon Club will be hosting the first Statewide Hackathon for students and co-designers from communities in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau to work on prototyping solutions to problems Alaskans face daily. This event will bring together programmers and makers with a passion for social impact.

Hackathons are a great way to build technical skills and prototype solutions that have a meaningful impact on the community. Local non-profit, Assistive Technology of Alaska, has provided Alaska Developer Alliance with common accessibility barriers Alaskans with disabilities can face. 

You are invited to the Statewide Hackathon Reception, Sunday, October 13th, 5:00pm at The Boardroom to see what problems teams were faced with and the solutions they created. Awards will be announced at 6:30pm.
