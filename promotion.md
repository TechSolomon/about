### Sending out a monthly newsletter
	Purpose: Show developers that there is an active programming community with events happening. Spread awareness about events for developers to participate in. Get attendance for events. Promote other groups working in tech that would like to build a following. Even if there are no events, send a newsletter letting people know that there are no events and we will be taking a break until the next event.
