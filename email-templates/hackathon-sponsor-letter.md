# Hackathon Template Email

Hi <their-name>,

My name is <your-name> and I am inquiring about <their-org> sponsoring the Alaska Hackathon on Oct 11th.

The AK Dev Alliance (https://akdevalliance.com/) is a programmer-led  volunteer organization that is committed to creating a tech industry within Alaska. We offer training to new and experienced programmers in an effort to increase the programming knowledge of any interested Alaskans. Earlier this month we brought up an expert in a new exciting language, Go, and offered a free weekend class. 

Now we are putting on a statewide hackathon in Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Juneau on Oct 11th.

Attached is a file that provides more info on the hackathon and our organization. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at this email or <your-number>.
