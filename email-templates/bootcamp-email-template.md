Hello future and current Gophers!

We're stoked for the first part of our 4 day Golang bootcamp tomorrow. For those of you who are based in Anchorage we'll see you at 9am at in Grant Hall room #231 at APU. For those of you who are out of town, but will be attending Ultimate Go next weekend, the zoom link is below.

The 3 day Ultimate Go course 9/13, 9/14, 9/15 will only be available on site.
This is a hands on workshop, please bring your charged laptop and charger with the Go environment installed. We will cover setting up your environment, however, internet on site is questionable and will be conserved for the Zoom conference. If you don't have a chance to install, please download the binary and bring it with you.

The goal for tomorrow is to introduce you to the syntax and some basic principles of Go so you can get the most out of Bill Kennedy's course. Don't stress if you get hung up on a concept.

Class starts at 9am. We will have coffee on-site.
Break at 11am
Lunch at 1pm

Lastly, food and beverage can be difficult for us to get funding for. There's a donate button at https://akdevalliance.com if you feel inclined to chip in for coffee.

Disclaimer, these are all of the things Director is currently doing for the sake of visibility. Need to figure out how to split these up so director role is more manageable and figure out what jobs should be handed off.
